we need to store the cart item so that when the page is refreshed it should not fall to default;

for that we are writing a function
function saveToStorage(){
    localStorage.setItem('cart','')
}

setitem here takes two strings 
first is name what ever we wanna save
second string is data we want to save
//we need to convert the cart to string

JSON.stringify(cart) //converting into string

//localStorage.getItem()//to get the stored item 
//get item only takes string i.e. in this case name of the set item('cart')
//as localstorage.get is only gives out just a string.
//so we need to convert back to noraml; 
//for that we use JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem());

#as intially the cart will be empty it will be showing null so we need to makesure that it shows 0 or some default value;
